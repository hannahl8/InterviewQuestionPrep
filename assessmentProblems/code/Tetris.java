/**
 * Module 3 â€“ Implementation Efficiency
 * <p>
 * Given a game field represented by a {@code height x width} matrix of integers and a figure represented
 * by a {@code 3 x 3} matrix, determine the column index in the game field from which to drop the figure
 * so that at least one fully occupied row is formed after the figure comes to rest.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both {@code field} and {@code figure} contain only {@code 0}s and {@code 1}s, where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code 1} represents an occupied cell</li>
 *   <li>{@code 0} represents a free cell</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can drop the figure at any column such that the entire {@code 3 x 3} figure matrix fits within
 * the width of the field. The figure falls downward until:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It reaches the bottom of the field</li>
 *   <li>Or lands on an occupied cell in the field that blocks further descent</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * After the figure has landed, check if any row in the resulting field is fully occupied
 * (i.e., all cells in that row are {@code 1}). If such a row exists, return the leftmost column index
 * from which the figure can be dropped to produce that result. If there are multiple valid positions,
 * you may return any one of them. If no such position exists, return {@code -1}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The figure must be dropped such that its entire {@code 3 x 3} shape fits within the field bounds,
 * even if some parts of the figure matrix are empty (i.e., contain {@code 0}s).</p>
 *
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example 1:
 * field = [
 *   [0, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 0],
 *   [1, 0, 0],
 *   [1, 1, 0]
 * ]
 * figure = [
 *   [0, 0, 1],
 *   [0, 1, 1],
 *   [0, 0, 1]
 * ]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Dropping the figure at column index 0 results in two full rows.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * field = [
 *   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 *   [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 *   [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
 * ]
 * figure = [
 *   [1, 1, 1],
 *   [1, 0, 1],
 *   [1, 0, 1]
 * ]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Only by dropping the figure at column index 2 is a full row formed.
